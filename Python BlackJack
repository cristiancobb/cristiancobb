"""This program defines a deck of cards and their values, and then simulates a game of Blackjack. The program deals two cards each to the player and dealer, 
and then prompts the player to hit or stand. The program then simulates the dealer's turn according to the standard rules of Blackjack. The program then 
determines the winner of the game based on the scores of the player and dealer.

This code uses a variety of Python features, including lists, dictionaries, loops, functions, and conditional statements. It also uses the random module to 
shuffle the deck of cards and deal random cards to the player and dealer."""
